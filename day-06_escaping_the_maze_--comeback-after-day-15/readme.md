# Day 6 - 16/10/2024
Functions, Code Blocks and While Loops

## Function
- `def` - Defining Functions - we use
    - [Functions Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
```python
def my_function():
    #Do this
    #Then do this
    #Finally do this
```
- WHILE LOOP
```python
while something_is_true:
    #do something repeatedly
```
- FOR LOOP x WHILE LOOP:
    - FOR LOOPS: Really good when you need to iterate over something and you need to do something with **EACH THING** that you're iterating over.
    - WHILE: Good to just simply wants to carry out a functionality until a certain condition.
        - While loops are more dangerous, due to possible Infinite Loops.
