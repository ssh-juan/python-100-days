# My Studies about Python
Following [Angela Yu's Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

### "Our brain is for thinking, not for storing"

### Python Primitive Data Types
1. Strings
2. Integers
3. Floats
4. Booleans

## Main Functions
- PRINT = `print()`
- PRINT FORMATTED (f-Strings)= `print(f"I am {age} years old")`
- INPUT = `input()`  (Obs.: the input will always be a String)
- LENGTH = `len()`  
- TO INT = `int()`  
- TO STR = `str()`  
- TO FLOAT = `float()`  
- TO BOOLEAN = `bool()`  
- ROUND A NUMBER = `round(number, ndigits)`  
- CONVERT TO LOWERCASE = `.lower()` (Example: `input().lower()`)  
```python
#Indentation is crucial in Python for conditionals
if condition:
    do this
else:
    do this
```

## Mathematical Operators
- ADDITION: `+`  
- ADDITION OF ACTUAL VALUE: `+=`  
- SUBTRACTION: `-`  
- MULTIPLICAÇÃO: `*`  
- DIVISÃO: `/` (sempre vai ser 'float')  
- DIVISÃO: `//` (remove todas as casas após a vírgulas, vira um 'int')  
- POTENCIAÇÃO: `**`  
- REMAINDER: `%` (Check the remainder, how many is remaining after that division)  

## Conditional Operators
- AND - `and`  
- OR - `or`  
- NOT - `not`  

## Comparison Operators
| Operator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| > | Greater Than |
| < | Less Than |
| >= | Greater than or Equal to |
| <= | Less than or Equal to |
| == | Equal to |
| != | Not Equal to |

## Main Libraries Used
- `random` - Randomisation

## Useful Tips
- There's a tip for an IDE called "Thonny". It helps to debug code easier for newbies.
- [ASCII Art Generator](https://ascii.co.uk/art)

## Projects
1. Band Name Generator
2. Tip Calculator
3. Treasure Island - Game
4. Rock-Paper-Scissors - Game
