# Understanding OOP
It's called Object Oriented Programming because it is trying to model a real world object.
For example, a "virtual restaurant" would have:
- A virtual Chef
- A virtual Waiter
- A virtual Cleaner
- A virtual Manager

- Waiter Example:  
    - has - attributes (basically a variable associated with a modeled object)
    ```py
    is_holding_plate = True
    tables_responsible = [4,5,6]
    ```
    - does - methods (are functions, what an object can do)
    ```py
    def take_order(table, order):
        #takes order to chef
    def take_payment(amount):
        #add money to restaurant
    ```
