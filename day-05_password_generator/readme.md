# Day 5 - 14/10/2024
For Loops, Range and Code Block

## Function
- FOR LOOP FOR LISTS
```python
for item in list_of_items:
    #do something
    #for the 'item', we give a name for a single item
```
- RANGE - `range(a, b, c)`
    - Creates a range from 'a' to 'b' (obs.: **NOT INCLUDING** the last number 'b'). Has to be used in conjunction with another function.
    - 'c' is optional. Is a "step" function that will jump characters from the number you input in.
        - Example: `range(1, 10, 3)` - It will steps 3 by 3. Result will be: `1, 4, 7, 10`
- FOR LOOP WITH RANGE
```python
for number in range(a, b)
    print(number)
```
- SUM - `sum()`
    - Get the sum from a List
- MAX - `max()`
    - Get the maximum value from a List
- RANDOM SHUFFLE - `random.shuffle(list_name)` Shuffles the order of the list
