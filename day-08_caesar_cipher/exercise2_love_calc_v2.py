# You are going to write a function called calculate_love_score() that tests the compatibility between two names.  To work out the love score between two people: 
# 1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.   
# 2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.   
# 3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number and print it out.

    combined_names = name1 + name2
    combined_names.lower()

    t = combined_names.count("t")
    r = combined_names.count("r")
    u = combined_names.count("u")
    e = combined_names.count("e")
    n1 = t + r + u + e

    o = combined_names.count("o")
    v = combined_names.count("v")
    e = combined_names.count("e")
    n2 = l + o + v + e

    score = int(str(n1) + str(n2))
