Functions with Inputs, Parameters and Arguments

## Function
- Functions with Inputs
    - In the example below `something` is the **Parameter**, and it's value inputted is **Argument** (the value of data)
```python
def my_function(something):
    #Do this with something
    #Then do this
    #Finally do this
```
- Functions with Multiple Inputs
```python
def my_function(a, b, c):
    #Do this with 'a'
    #Then do this with 'b'
    #Finally do this 'c'
```
- COUNT - `count()`
    - Return the number of times the value appears in the **list**.
```python
#Counts how many times '9' appears in the list
points = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7, 8, 9, 3, 1]

x = points.count(9)
```
- MODULO EQUALS - `%=`
